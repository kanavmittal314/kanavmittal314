- 👋 Hi, I’m @kanavmittal314. I'm a third-year at UC Berkeley studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences (EECS).
- 👀 I’m interested in computer science and its application to other fields, especially education and biology/healthcare. More specifically, I am interested in full-stack/backend development and AI/ML. 
- 🌱 I’m well-versed in Python, Java, JavaScript/TypeScript, Go, C and SQL as well as frameworks like React/React Native, PyTorch, and TensorFlow. Looking to learn C++ soon!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that either currently or have the potential to positively impact many people.
- 📫 How to reach me: kanavmittal@berkeley.edu
