- 👋 Hi, I’m @kanavmittal314. I'm a first-year at UC Berkeley studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences (EECS).
- 👀 I’m interested in computer science and its application to other fields, especially education and biology/healthcare. More specifically, I am interested in frontend, backend, or full stack development.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript/TypeScript, React Native, Node.js, and Firebase. What's to come? C, C++, AWS, NoSQL-databases, and more.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that either currently or have the potential to positively impact many people.
- 📫 How to reach me: kanavmittal@berkeley.edu
